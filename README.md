A deep learning-based tool to automatically replace censored artwork in hentai with plausible reconstructions.

Before DeepCreamPy can be used, the user must color censored regions in their hentai green with an image editing program like GIMP or Photoshop. DeepCreamPy takes the green colored images as input, and a neural network automatically fills in the censored regions.

You can download the latest release for Windows 64-bit [here](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/releases/latest). 

For users interested in compiling DeepCreamPy themselves, DeepCreamPy can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Features
- Decensoring images of any size
- Decensoring of ANY shaped censor (e.g. black lines, pink hearts, etc.)
- Decensoring of mosaic decensors
- Limited support for decensoring black and white/monochrome images
- Generate multiple variations of decensors from the same image

## Limitations
The decensorship is for color hentai images that have minor to moderate censorship of the penis or vagina. If a vagina or penis is completely censored out, decensoring will be ineffective.

It does NOT work with:
- Hentai with screentones (e.g. printed hentai)
- Real life porn
- Censorship of nipples
- Censorship of anus
- Animated gifs/videos
